# Provides mappings between the index of the concatenated joy message from the Logitech Cordless RumblePad 2 to user readable button names.
# Note that we have concatenated the axes and button states into one single array.
# LED beside MODE button on RumblePad2 joystick should be turned on and joystick should be in "Direct" input mode for these mappings to work.
# The button names mapped here are the names that are used in the snakelib_control/param/joy_to_gait.yaml file.
# 'back' button will always be used to switch between modes.
# On the Axes right and down are negative values, left and up are positive values.
