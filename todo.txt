# Known issues
- Sensor watch dogs throws unreasonable number of warnings.
- Sometimes gaitlib controller is intialized with empty string for desired gait.
- When update is called for such controller, it throws error for parameters not being found.

# TODO
- Add capability to hebi node to reconnect upon lost connection.
- Replace HEBI sensor message with default ROS messages.
- Rolling helix in pole climb is oscillating for fixed tightness. Might want to tune: 
    - Motor gains
    - Gait parameters
- Add camera launch to demo application
- Thermal camera tuning
